        The car needs to make a decision on how to move (what acceleration to give)
        based on these parameters

        For this hardcoded car, we use 2 simple rules:

        1. If the car is very close to either side of the track, move away from the track
           i.e try to stay in the centre as much as possible

        2. Try to maintain a constant forward speed of 0.1 m/s
